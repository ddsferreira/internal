# First Attempt

This attempt is based on the following concepts:

1. Create module Internal to extend a given class 'Foo'
2. Use protected to define the internal interface
3. Use binding_of_caller gem to udpate the methods visibility

## NOTE: Abandoned since we couldn't get a solution for class methods
